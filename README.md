# <span style="color:deepskyblue"> Neurodegenerative Disease Detection </span>

This repository is an extensive open-source project showcasing the seamless integration of **object detection and tracking** using **YOLOv8** (object detection algorithm), along with **Streamlit** (a popular Python web application framework for creating interactive web apps). The project offers a user-friendly and customizable interface designed to detect and track objects in real-time video streams from sources such as RTSP, UDP, and YouTube URLs, as well as static videos and images.

## <span style="color:deepskyblue">WebApp Demo on Streamlit Server</span>

Thank you team [Streamlit](<https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit>) for the community support for the cloud upload. 

This app is up and running on Streamlit cloud server!!! You can check the demo of this web application on this link 
[neuro-disorder-detector-webapp](https://neuro-disorder-detector.streamlit.app/)

**Note**: In the demo, Due to non-availability of GPUs, you may encounter slow video inferencing.
